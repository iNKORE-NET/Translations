    "en-US": "iNKORE Studios wasn't founded in a boardroom - it was born from a late-night conversation a boy with a playful soul and a tech-hardened 'dalao'. In 2022, we became an experiment: what if a studio refused to choose only one between art and engineering?\r\nThe early days were chaotic and unglamorous. We built our first app in the bedroom. It wasn't a masterpiece, but it proved one thing: we could make things happen, even scrappy experiments can spark joy.\r\nToday, that chaotic spirit lives on. We're still independent by design — answering to our team and audiences, not investors. Because the best work happens when you're free to break the rules, follow your heart, and do the things that you're really into.",
    "zh-CN": "iNKORE Studios 并非诞生于董事会会议室 - 它诞生于一次深夜对话，一个拥有顽皮灵魂的男孩和一个技术娴熟的 \"dalao\"。2022 年，我们开启了一项实验：如果一个工作室不肯在视觉艺术和工程之间二选一，会怎么样？\r\n早期的日子混乱而平淡。我们在卧室开发了我们的第一个应用程序。它并非杰作，但它证明了一件事：我们可以创造奇迹，即使是零散的实验也能激发快乐。\r\n如今，这种混乱的精神依然存在。我们仍然秉持独立精神——对团队和受众负责，而不是对投资者负责。因为最好的作品往往发生在你能够自由地打破规则、追随内心、做你真正喜欢的事情的时候。"
