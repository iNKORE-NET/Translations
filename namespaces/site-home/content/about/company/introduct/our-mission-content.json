    "en-US": "This freedom isn't rebellion - it's more like a responsibility. It lets us build software that serves people, not shareholders, and tell stories that transcend borders and cultures. We're a small team by choice, because we do believe that true craft thrives in intimacy. Every line of code, every stroke and frame of film is a testament to what happens when creators answer only to their own standards.",
    "zh-CN": "这种自由不是叛逆 - 更像是一种责任。它让我们能够构建服务于人类而非资本机器的软件，讲述超越国界和文化的故事。我们选择了一个小团队，因为我们相信真正的创造在密集联系中蓬勃发展。每一行代码，每一笔和每一帧电影都是创作者只对自己的标准负责时所发生的事情的证明。",
