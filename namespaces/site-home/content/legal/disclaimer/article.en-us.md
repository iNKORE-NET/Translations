## Testimonials

Our offerings may contain testimonials from users of our services. These testimonials reflect the real-life experiences and opinions of such users. However, the experiences are personal to those particular users, and may not necessarily be representative of all users of our services. We do not claim, and you should not assume, that all users will have the same experiences. YOUR INDIVIDUAL RESULTS MAY VARY.

### Editing and Enhancing

The testimonials we offer are submitted in various forms such as text, audio and/or video, and are reviewed by us before being posted. We may enhance the expression, grammar and vocabulary of the original post. Additionally, we may translate, extend the length of the post to meet layout requirements, remove personally identifiable or other inappropriate information, and make other changes to ensure the testimonial is appropriate for our audience, provided that the original meaning is not altered.

We do not edit the content of the testimonials in a way that alters the meaning or context of the original user experience.

### Affiliation and Compensation

The views and opinions contained in the testimonials belong solely to the individual user and do not reflect our views and opinions. We are not affiliated with users who provide testimonials, and users are not paid or otherwise compensated for their testimonials.

### Medical Disclaimer

The testimonials are not intended, nor should they be construed, as claims that our products and/or services can be used to diagnose, treat, mitigate, cure, prevent, or otherwise be used for any disease or medical condition. No testimonials have been clinically proven or evaluated.

## Technical Vulnerabilities

We take the security of our offerings seriously and strive to protect them from technical vulnerabilities. However, no system can be completely secure, and we cannot guarantee that our offerings will be free from technical vulnerabilities or unauthorized access at all times.

We encourage users to take appropriate precautions when using our services, such as keeping their devices and software up to date, using strong passwords, and being cautious about sharing personal information.

For the availability and reliability of our services, you may find more information in the Terms of Use or End User License Agreement (EULA) for each specific product or service.

## Limitation of Liability

We strive to provide reliable and high-quality offerings. However, please note the following important limitations regarding liability and responsibility:

### User Responsibility for Losses

If you experience any loss or damage as a result of using our offerings, and such loss is due to factors within your own control or environment — including, but not limited to, the use of incorrect system or configurations, unauthorized or pirated versions, cracked or modified versions, unofficial distribution channels, or failure to use the latest official version (or any Long-Term Support version that is still supported) — you are solely responsible for that loss or damage. We do not accept any liability or warranty for losses or damages resulting from such factors.

### Liability for Issues Attributable to us

If your loss or damage is directly attributable to an issue on our side, our responsibility depends on the nature of your access to our offerings:

- **Open Source, Free, or Unpaid Access:**  
    If the product or service is provided as open source, free of charge, or accessed through unpaid means (including, but not limited to, free trial cards, promotional events, or other non-purchased access methods), we do not accept any liability or provide any warranty for any resulting loss or damage.

- **Paid Users:**  
    If you have paid for access to our offerings (including purchasing licenses, subscriptions, purchasing trial cards, or discount vouchers), our liability will be governed by specific Terms of Use or End User License Agreement (EULA) applicable to that product or service.

### Force Majeure

We are not liable for any failure to perform our obligations under this policy or any specific Terms of Use or End User License Agreement (EULA) if such failure results from events beyond our reasonable control, including but not limited to:

- Natural disasters (e.g., earthquakes, floods, storms, pandemics)

- Acts of war, armed conflict, labor disputes, civil unrest, government shutdowns, or other political events that disrupt normal operations

- Governmental actions (include but not limited to blockades, bans, censorship), regulations, or restrictions

- Technical failures or disruptions in telecommunications, electricity, internet services, or other infrastructure

### Precedence of Product-Specific Terms

Both the general rules above and any product-specific Terms of Use, End User License Agreement (EULA), or similar legal documents are effective and apply to your use of our offerings. However, if a specific product’s agreement provides additional terms or contains provisions that differ from or conflict with the general rules, the terms of the product-specific agreement will take precedence and may override the base rules as necessary.

## Politically Sensitive Content

At iNKORE!, we are committed to serving a global audience with respect, inclusivity, and neutrality. We recognize that certain elements on our website — such as national flags, maps, country or region names, and other geographic or cultural references—may be considered politically sensitive or subject to differing interpretations around the world.

### Neutrality and Intent

Our company maintains a strictly neutral stance on all political, territorial, and cultural matters. The inclusion of any flag, map, country or region name, or related symbol on our website is solely for the purpose of enhancing user experience and facilitating navigation. These elements do not represent or imply any political position, endorsement, or viewpoint by iNKORE!.

### Source of Materials

The images, icons, and other materials used to represent countries, regions, or territories are sourced from publicly available resources on the internet. While we strive for accuracy and respect in all representations, we acknowledge that errors or omissions may occur.

### About Caching and Local Devices

Please note that some resources on our website or in our applications may be cached by your browser, device, or intermediary proxy servers. As a result, updates or corrections to content may not be immediately visible and could take some time to appear on your end.
