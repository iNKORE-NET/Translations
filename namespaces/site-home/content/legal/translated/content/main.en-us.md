## Governing Language

All content, terms, conditions, and policies published by iNKORE! — including but not limited to websites, applications, marketing materials, product documentation, and legal notices — are originally authored in **English (United States)**. In the event of any discrepancy, ambiguity, or conflict between the English (U.S.) version and any translated version, the **English (U.S.) version shall prevail** and be deemed the sole authoritative reference.

## Translations for Convenience

Translations of our content are provided solely for informational convenience. While we strive to ensure accuracy, translated materials may contain errors, omissions, or contextual inaccuracies. Such translations **do not constitute legally binding commitments, warranties, or guarantees** by iNKORE!.

Translated materials come from various sources, some may be generated by machine translation, while others may be contributed by unaffiliated community volunteers. iNKORE! does not endorse or guarantee the accuracy of these translations.

## No Reliance on Translations

By accessing translated materials, you acknowledge and agree that:

1. Translations are not a substitute for the official English (U.S.) version.

2. iNKORE disclaims all liability for damages arising from reliance on translated content.

3. Legal rights, obligations, or interpretations shall be derived exclusively from the English (U.S.) source.

## Date and Time Formats

Throughout our website, products, and all promotional materials, the following standard date and time formats are used as defaults:

1. **Default Date Format**: MM/dd/yyyy (e.g., `05/15/2023` represents May, the 15th day of the year 2023)

2. **Default Time Format**: HH:mm:ss (military time, e.g., `14:30:00` represents 2:30 in the afternoon)

These formats apply when no other specific format is clearly identifiable. In some contexts where a different format is clearly established and consistently used, that established format will take precedence for that specific context only.

All scheduled events, deadlines, promotions, and time-sensitive information should be interpreted according to the applicable format, defaulting to the standards above when not otherwise specified.

## Updates & Amendments

The English (U.S.) version of our content may be revised, updated, or supplemented without prior notice. Translated versions may not reflect these changes in real time.
